            <h2>1. What it is</h2>
            <h3>Historical Journey</h3>
            <p>The South Rhodesian Seacat is a small, furry mammal that has adapted to life in the underground river of the Molopo in Southern Africa. It has a sleek, streamlined body that allows it to move quickly through the water, and it is covered in dense fur that insulates it from the cold, dark environment of the river. The Seacat has large, webbed tentacles that it uses to wade through the water, and it has a long, powerful tail that helps it to steer and balance.</p>
            <h3>Current Conditions</h3>
            <p>The South Rhodesian Seacat is currently facing a number of threats to its survival. Habitat loss due to human development is one of the biggest threats, as the underground river of the Molopo is being polluted and diverted for irrigation and other uses. Additionally, the Seacat is hunted by humans for its fur, which is considered to be valuable.</p>
            <h3>Projected</h3>
            <p>Without significant conservation efforts, it is likely that the South Rhodesian Seacat will continue to decline in numbers and may eventually become extinct.</p>

            <h2>2. Where it occurs</h2>
            <p>The underground river of the Molopo is located in Southern Africa. Historically, it was discovered in the Zambezi river before Rhodesia was split into Zambia and Zimbabwe. Due to vigorous hunting efforts of the great Zimbabwean tribes, it was forced into the underground river of the Molopo.</p>

            <h2>DISCLAIMER - THIS IS A SPOOF</h2>
            <p>This animal isn't real. It was created via a fun campfire story. During this process we realised how important wildlife preservation is, which is why we decided to create this little website with ChatGPT ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ . Note, however that the donation link is real. It takes you to SANParks. They do a lot of work for wildlife conservation and would greatly appreciate further donations. We aren't affiliated with them whatsoever and they have absolutely no hand in this ðŸ˜Š. This was just a little bit of fun between some friends who love nature and some crazy dude who wanted to play with understanding we hosting ðŸ’ª.</p>
